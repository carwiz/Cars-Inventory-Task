# Cars Inventory Task
Welcome to the Cars Inventory application exam. This app is simple and responsive web application that allows customers to manage their cars inventory, with an easy, user friendly interface.

Your technological stack will be:
* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: Node.js
* Database / Persistent storage solution of your choice

You can use any general purpose libraries, however, please note, you will be required to add additional functionality after you finish the project, when choosing libraries, keep that in mind.

Example of things you can (only if you _like to_, it's just an example) use:
[express](https://expressjs.com/),
[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios),
[material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)

And of course - any boilerplate you want. for example:
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
